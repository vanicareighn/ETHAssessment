This code consists of creating a new token for you NFTs. It is named as FLIPCOIN and labaled as a FLP as an example for the created currency name. It has 3 Functions (Mapping, Mint and Burn) Mapping means a set of hash tables/parameters to store a type of data collection and key value pairs. Next is the Mint function which is a process where you can transact and create your own set of amount for your own NFT, it is validated on the blockchain to create a new asset and store your own data and last is the Burn Function same as you will delete or remove a selected type of data and amount it can effectively removes your tokens from the available supply.
